> The plan is to not have any plan ✌🏻 Let go & enjoy the current moment!

We often have a tendency to chart out our lives based on specific timelines—earning a college degree by a certain age, getting married, having kids, and adhering to financial goals. Yet, life doesn't always follow our scripted plans. There are numerous unpredictable variables that can disrupt our carefully laid-out expectations. Despite our belief in having control, life unfolds with its own agenda.

Instead of investing our hearts in meticulously planning every detail, it might be more fulfilling to loosen our grip on the outcome and savor the journey itself. Predicting the future is impossible, but that doesn't mean we should attempt to control every aspect or live with constant anxiety. Worrying about plans doesn't lead to happiness; it only shifts our focus between the present and future, leaving us with regrets.

While some level of planning is beneficial, becoming too attached to those plans can lead to chaos. Life isn't a product with a predetermined set of features to be delivered by a specific date. Embracing flexibility and finding joy in life's small moments is crucial. Although we'll undoubtedly reach our goals, they may not always manifest in the exact way we envisioned. It's best to appreciate what life is offering in the present moment and just enjoy the journey! 

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

*Life becomes easy when we take it easy!* 😁
