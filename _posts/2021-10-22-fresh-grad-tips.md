Embarking on one's initial professional endeavor often stirs up a mix of nerves and anticipation. Entry into the workforce occurs at diverse stages in life; some secure internships during their undergraduate years, while others plunge into the competitive job market as full-time engineers post-graduation. Regardless of when one enters the professional sphere, there's a universal uncertainty about how to navigate and thrive in this new environment. While we may possess confidence in our skills, the corporate world swiftly imparts the lesson that a stellar college GPA or triumph in competitive exams doesn't necessarily foretell success in the workplace. While domain knowledge certainly aids progress, it rarely serves as the sole yardstick for ascending the career ladder.

In this post I share some tips on building your brand in your new job/ internship -

### Ensure assigned tasks are delivered on time 

As easy as this sounds, try to ensure that whatever task is given, is finished on time. In college we often have the tendency to wait till the last day to even begin working on our assignments. Interestingly, beginning work at the last moment even works out well in that situation. But in corporate culture, such ethic will not fly. 

Use tools like stickies or notepads to keep track of deadlines. The initial phase of any job can be a bit overwhelming, and it's crucial not to lose sight of your tasks. If you face challenges in a specific area, don't hesitate to seek help from senior developers/ mentors after trying to solve it on your own. Always remember, the key to increasing your value in the team is by performing your role effectively. As a junior, exceeding expectations is possible only if you consistently deliver tasks on time with high quality.

### Foster building relationships within the team

The first point above is a segue to understanding that we cannot deliver huge projects on our own. We frequently depend on others for their expertise, and they, in turn, may rely on us to progress on a task. If we appear unapproachable, it can discourage collaboration, potentially causing missed opportunities. Therefore, in the early years, concentrate on establishing trust and building relationships. In corporate culture, trust is something you have to earn. Your new team will trust you more when your words and actions align. In the initial years, the goal should not solely be to earn recognition. Delivering smaller tasks punctually can contribute to building trust. Additionally, focus on creating positive relations with the team by adapting to their working style and treating everyone with respect.

The dynamics of working in a corporate setting differ significantly from being a student in a classroom, and the reverse is also true. While being friendly, trustworthy, and respectful contributes to relationship-building, another crucial trait is developing empathy. In our younger years, our focus tends to be solely on our own problems, expecting others to accommodate our specific needs. Cultivating high empathy at work not only enhances your understanding of the team's goals but also keeps you mindful of the skills you need to develop for success.

There might be occasions when you find yourself working tirelessly, pondering why your company doesn't offer perks like your friend's company. You could also be questioning why your team is putting in late hours. However, complaining and creating a fuss about the situation will only exacerbate it. Your colleagues are facing the same challenges, and, naturally, people prefer working with those who maintain a positive attitude. Dwelling on negativity will only impede your progress. Collaborating with a mature individual is consistently rewarding! Cultivating the right attitude is instrumental in fostering positive relationships.

### Keep learning
Finally, education is an ongoing journey extending beyond the classroom. The tech industry, in particular, demands continuous adaptability to evolving technologies. Frequently, we find ourselves grappling with the need to swiftly comprehend the intricacies of new technologies and formulate design strategies for their integration into our projects. Hence, the ability to learn rapidly becomes paramount. Merely skimming through a high-level overview of a framework should ideally provide us with a foundational understanding.

***Delving into Depth***

As we progress into more senior roles within our team, delving deeply into these technologies to grasp their proper utilization becomes imperative. A piece of advice from my manager has stuck with me - the true comprehension of a concept is evident when one can succinctly explain it in just a single line. The objective is to avoid becoming a generalist without mastery. With increasing seniority, it's advisable to specialize in a specific domain, becoming an invaluable asset to the organization. Assessing our understanding of a concept involves attempting to teach it to others concisely. While the ability to delve deep is crucial, it's a quality that can be honed as we advance in seniority.
